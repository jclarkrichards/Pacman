# Pacman
This will manage my Pacman code so I can see the development process

Right now I have the ghosts and pacman moving around a node map from node to node.  The pellets are there too and pacman can eat the pellets.  The ghosts automatically swtich between their two main modes:  attack and scatter.  If pacman eats a pellet then they will enter freight mode.
